# Problem with dropdown populating at video 163 of Udemy, Complete Node 

The Planets database works. Atlas is populated. I get the right count back, I've deployed multiple times, the log shows a 200 for GET /planets, and yet the drop-down won't populate. I've gone over the code multiple times looking for some flaw, and have tried to compare it wherever possible with Adam's github code

Note: You will need to supply an atlas password in server/src/server.js.
 
### Note to self: should delete repository before 2024
